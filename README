This a collection of simple utilities I keep in ~/bin (a directory I add
to my PATH).

# .bashrc

My .bashrc lives inside here (why not? it's executable).

Note: ~/.bash_profile is loaded by interactive login shells; ~/.bashrc is loaded
by interactive non-login shells. In other words, when you create a new Terminal
window, .bash_profile is loaded; if you type `bash` and hit return, .bashrc is
loaded.

To properly install this, create a symbolic link:

    $ cd $HOME
    $ ln -s bin/.bashrc .bashrc

Then ensure that ~/.bash_profile loads your .bashrc file:

    # Load .bashrc if it exists
    test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

- import scripts from MacBook
- check $PATH
- install/update /etc/motd file
