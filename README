This a collection of simple utilities I keep in ~/bin (a directory I add
to my PATH).

# View UNIX manual pages as beautiful PDF documents

`manpdf.sh` is probably the best thing in here. Check it out!

# Making sense of bash init scripts

I store my bash init scripts in here. Why not?

The manual page for `bash` explains what's up (see the "INVOCATION" section),
but the general idea is that .profile is for login shells and .bashrc is for
interactive non-login shells.

In other words, if you open a new Terminal window, .profile is loaded. If you
type `bash` and hit return, .bashrc is loaded.
